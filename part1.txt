# An RFM69-Based Weather Station


## Introduction
Recently I heard about some new 900MHz radio transceivers from Adafruit called the RFM69. The RFM95 is a low-cost radio based on the SX1276/77/78/79 module from SEMTECH, and can be easily interfaced with a microcontroller 
such as an Arduino. I am interested in all things RF, so I bought a couple from Digi-Key to experiment with. I wanted to use these radios to build an outdoor weather station which I could customize and add to over time. 
There are many complete weather stations available that are plug-n-play, but I wanted to build something myself to keep my electronics skills fresh.
