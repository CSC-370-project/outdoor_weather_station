# Enclosure sourcing

The enclosure for the RFM69 and associated PCBs had to to withstand wind, rain, snow, ect. The requirements are summarized below:

+ prevent ingress of water and moisture
+ prevent ingress of dust
+ prevent ingress of bugs

These requirements led me to search for an enclosure with a NEMA4x rating. Such products are available on Digi-Key, but there are so many to choose from! Initially I began seaching the Hammond Mfg website, but
I found some relatively inexpensive ones from Bud Industries.
