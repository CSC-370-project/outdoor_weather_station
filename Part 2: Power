# Going Solar

Initially I had considered powering the weather station from a battery, but after some initial testing, I quickly realized I had to have a constant power source other than a battery. The batteries died too quickly!
Another option was to program the microcontrollers to go into sleep mode and wake up infrequently, but I still did not like the idea of having to recharge a battery on a regular basis - I wanted to automate everything!
I decided that a solar panel would be necessary.
